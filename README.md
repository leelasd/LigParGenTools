## Creating Custom Solvent Box For Pure liquid simulations
Most of the FF such as AMBER, OPLS-AA and CHARMM are built using bottom up approach i.e, they are parameterized to reproduce condensed phase properties of organic building blocks of macromolecules. To validate the performance of these force fields one need to look at their performance in reproducing pure liquid properties.
